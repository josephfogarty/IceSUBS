# Heat Equation Solver in Sea Ice

This repository is designed to hold all of the codes for solving the heat equation numerically in a block of sea ice. Eventually, this code will pair with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) code that is being used in the Environmental Fluid Mechanics laboratory at Princeton University.
