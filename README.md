## Heat Equation Solver in Sea Ice

# Overview

This repository is designed to hold all of the codes for solving one-dimensional the heat equation numerically in a block of sea ice floating on sea water. Eventually, this code will be coupled with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) code that is being used in the Environmental Fluid Mechanics laboratory at Princeton University.
